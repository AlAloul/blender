Blender is the Laravel template that is used for (nearly) all our projects.

You may use our template but please notice that we offer no support whatsoever. We also don't
follow semver. We do not guarantee that the code is stable. In short: when using this
you're on your own.

###Contributing

Generally We won't accept any PR requests to Blender. If you feel that you have discovered a bug or have an idea to improve the code, contact us first before your start coding.
